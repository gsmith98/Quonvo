# Quonvo

This is a clone of a collaborative project made at the 2 month mark when my involvement with it ended. The original repo is hosted privately by the Quonvo founder, Mitchell Troyanovsky (github user Mtroyanovsky1). This snapshot was made public with his permission.

To check out the current status of the ongoing project, please visit quonvo.com.

I am not currently hosting a live demo of this snapshot, but I plan to in the near future. Some minor work needs to be done to attach my own database and flesh out the sign up functionality to support real users before that point.
